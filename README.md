# MailPipe - Make emails do stuff

Follow [@mailpipe](https://twitter.com/mailpipe) on twitter for updates!
## Goal
Get notifications pushed to a callback url when an email matching an account is received. Provide an API to manage email accounts, callbacks, and emails.

# Usage

### Get your token
```
$ curl -d "username=tim&password=secret" example.com:8000/get_token/
{
    "token": "866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623"
}
```
### List accounts (none at first)
```
$ curl -X GET http://example:8000/accounts/ -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
[]
```

### Make a new email account
The host of the address can include any (sub)domain that is using this mailserver as the MX record.
```
$ curl -X POST -d "address=test@example.com&callback_url=http://my-other-site.com/callback" \
example.com:8000/accounts -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
{
    "url": "http://example:8000/address/test@example.com/", 
    "address": "test@example.com", 
    "callback_url": "https://my-other-site.com/callback"
}
```
### List your accounts
```
$ curl -X GET http://example:8000/accounts/ -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
[
    {
        "url": "http://example:8000/accounts/test@example.com/",
        "address": "test@example.com",
        "callback_url": "https://my-other-site.com/callback"
    }
]
```
### List emails recived on your new account (none yet)
```
$ curl -X GET http://example:8000/accounts/test@example.com/ -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
{
    "url": "http://example.com:8000/accounts/test@example.com/",
    "address": "test@example.com",
    "callback_url": "http://my-other-site.com/callback/", 
    "emails": []
}
```
### Send an email
Email test@example.com
```
$ curl -X GET http://example:8000/accounts -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
{
    "url": "http://example:8000/accounts/test@example.com/", 
    "address": "test@example.com",
    "callback_url": "http://my-other-site.com/callback", 
    "emails": [
        "http://example.com:8000/emails/1/"
        ]
}
```
### Callback
Now `https://my-other-site.com/callback?email_url=http://example.com:8000/emails/1/` will have been called which you can can now use to retrieve the email message.

```
$ curl -X GET http://example:8000/emails/1/ -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
{
    "url": "http://example:8000/emails/1/", 
    "id": 1, 
    "text": "bar\n", 
    "html": "<div dir=\"ltr\">bar</div>\n", 
    "to": "\"test+something\" <test+something@example.com>", 
    "frm": "Tim Watts <tim@readevalprint.com>", 
    "subject": "foo", 
    "date": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 19:33:02 -0700", 
    "attachments": [], 
    "route_url": "http://example:8000/accounts/test", 
    "route": "test", 
    "address": "test+something", 
    "host": "example.com", 
    "created_at": "2013-05-01T02:33:23.385Z"
}
```
### Delete the email
Now that you have read and done stuff to your email, you want to delete it.
```
$ curl -X DELETE http://example:8000/email/1/ -H 'Authorization: Token 866ee9de3d36afc0d9d37dle0c901b53r4811623'
```


# Installation

```
$ mkvirtualenv mailpipe
$ git clone git://github.com/readevalprint/mailpipe-project.git
cd ./mailpipe-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Setup

### Start salmon on port 25
First find your normal user id and group id. https://salmon-mail.readthedocs.io
```
>>> import os
>>> os.getuid()
1001
>>> os.getgid()
1001
>>> ^D
```

Start it as root, and give the uid and gid to drop to.
```
cd ./mailserver
$ sudo `which salmon` start -uid 1001 -gid 1001 
```
### Verify it is running

```
$ telnet YOUR_HOST 25
Trying IP_ADDRESS...
Connected to YOUR_HOST.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 YOUR_HOST Python SMTP proxy version 0.2
```
Press ctr+]
```
^]
telnet> close
Connection closed.
```

### Add your local_settings.py for django 
Specifically you need to set your SECRET_KEY. 

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secret-key

Here we are using Django to store message. This is not recoomended for production.

See: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html#celerytut-broker
```
# mailpipe/local_settings.py 
from settings import *

INSTALLED_APPS += ('kombu.transport.django', )


SECRET_KEY = 'CHANGE_ME'
BROKER_URL = 'django://'
```

### Create your database
By default we are using sqlite3 but you should alse change that when you deploy. Go ahead and create your admin here too.
```
$ ./manage.py syncdb
```

### Set your Django Site
Here you will want to use the host and port your server is using that is public on the internet.
```
$ ./manage.py shell_plus
In [1]: s = Site.objects.get_current()

In [2]: s.domain = 'http://exmaple.com:8000'

In [3]: s.name = 'example.com'

In [4]: s.save()

In [5]: exit
```

### Start the message queue
Leave this running.
```
./manage.py celeryd -l info
```

### Start the dev server
Do this on a different session (byobu or screen is helpful) and don't forget to use your virtualenv
```
$ workon mailpipe
$ cd mailpipe-project/mailpipe/
$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
Open your browser and goto http://YOUR_HOST:8000 and sign in as your admin account you made above and follow the instructions.

# Production
I would recommend PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Nginx, uwsgi, and of course, serve everything over https
